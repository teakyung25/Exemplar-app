# Exemplar
## My project is called Exemplar.

### It is an application that connects mentors and mentees on a effective mentoring platform inside of specific nodes created by the administrator of the node.

# Learning Proccess

### Through my experience of programming this application I have learned and intergrated the following:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- Bcyrpt.js
- Passport.js
- React.js
- Babel.js

### In this project I learned how to effectively create a node webserver using express and connecting the webserver to a database. This allows the application to complete more complex tasks it needs to accomplish on the frontend and the backend. I have also experimented with a front end library called react to make a more fluent and dynamic user experience. To summerize, the idea of backend development something I wanted to understand and learn about, but it was alway hard to find a place to start, I was able to find a bit more sense of direct with this project. 

# Future 

### I have tried to deploy my application to the cloud, but limited budget has prevent a immediate migration, but is something to be implemented in the near future.
